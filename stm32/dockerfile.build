# Dockerfile to build tools for building firmware binary
#
# Thanks to <https://github.com/lucaszanella/coldcard-docker> for inspiration.
#
# Also somewhat based on

#

# PROBLEM: alpine has `gcc-arm-none-eabi` but it's not in main repo, instead its part of "edge"?
#
# - for firmware v4.0.2, I used alphine:3.13.2 as base, but that doesn't work now for
#   some random reason, and I don't care to debug why.
#
#FROM alpine:3.13.2
